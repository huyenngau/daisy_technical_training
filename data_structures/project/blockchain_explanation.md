1. Why did you use that data structure?
I used a linked list to link all of this together in a block chain 

For this problem, I will brief my solution: 
- Init head is None for BlockChain class 
- First, I need to create a block before add it to chain 
This method inits data and last_block to get previous_hash
The rest of informations: 
"timestamp" is Greenwich Mean Time, "hash" is generated by calc_hash() function 
- Then, implement a method to append block to the end of BlockChain 

2. The efficiency (time and space) of your solution:
- create_new_block: O(1)
- add_to_chain: O(n)
