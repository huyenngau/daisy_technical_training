1. Using Mergesort to sort the input_list because Mergesort has time complexity is O(n log n)
Init 2 variables x, y are equal to 0. 
x is filled with digits at the even indices of the sorted input list.
y is filled with digits at the odd indices of the sorted input list. 
(x, y) is output of problem. 

This solution makes The number of digits in both the numbers cannot differ by more than 1.

2. 
- Time complexity:
     + Mergesort: O(n log n)
     + Find two numbers such that their sum is maximum: O(n)
     Total: O(n log n)
 
- Space Complexity: O(1).
Constant extra space is needed.
