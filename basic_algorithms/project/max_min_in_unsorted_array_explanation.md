1. 
The idea is init a min number and a max number are equal to the first element in the input list.
Then find the max and min in a single traversal.
If next element in the input list is smaller than the min number, assign min number to that element
Else if that element is greater than the max number, assign max number to that element.
Finally, return min number and max number.

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)
